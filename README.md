# CopynRename

<p>This Python + Powershell program allows the user to make a copy of files in one location (folders and sub-folders) to another while also renaming them with keyword and date last modified. 
  User is first prompted to input, where they could enter the origin location, keyword, and destination location. 
  Then, copy all the files within the location to another and renaming them when you run the Powershell. 
  For example: If I input the original location (\Downloads) and input the keyword "test", it will copy and files containing the word test to a location of your choice.
